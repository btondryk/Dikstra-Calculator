# Dikstra-Calculator
Year 1 Coding Data Structures: Created a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, square roots, sine, cosine, and tangent. Purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency using Stacks and Queues. The Queue and Stack library that this calculator uses are my own libraries that were created to further demonstrate my knowledge of Queues and Stacks.
